# Description:
Augmented Reality demo built in Unity 2022 using Vuforia, featuring two characters (Ghost and Adventurer) with animations. The characters automatically switch between idle and attack states when their corresponding Image Targets come close to each other, and return to idle after moving apart.

# Features:

Ghost: Idle and Attack animations controlled via isAttacking bool.

Adventurer: Idle_Normal, Attack01/Attack02 loop, Idle_Battle, returning to Idle_Normal after 3 seconds.

Distance-based interaction between Image Targets triggers character behavior.
