# 3D Hand Modeling and XR Integration

This repository focuses on creating a custom 3D hand model and integrating it with the Unity XR Toolkit for use as player controllers. The main goal was to utilize a 3D modeling tool (Blender) to create a five-fingered hand model and integrate it into a pre-configured Unity XR scene, serving as the visual representation for both the left and right hand controllers.

# Project Structure & Tools
The solution is integrated into the existing `Lab2` folder, which contains the necessary Unity XR setup.

# Software Used
* **3D Modeling & Rigging:** Blender (v4.4.3)
* **Texturing:** Medibang Paint (for customization and detailing)
* **Game Engine:** Unity (v2022.x LTS)
* **XR Setup:** Unity XR Interaction Toolkit

# 3D Model
* The hand model consists of 5 fingers and a basic palm structure.
* **Rigging:** The `.blend` file includes a basic armature (rig) to facilitate future animation, though animations have not been implemented yet.

# Texturing Process
1.  A seamless base texture (tileable) was chosen and scaled up.
2.  The base texture was imported into **Medibang Paint** for detailed painting.
3.  **Custom Details Added:**
    * Lighter coloring on the palm area.
    * Subtle lines defining the palm creases and finger joint cartilages.
    * Colored fingernails for visual distinction.
